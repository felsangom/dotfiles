# Felipe Gomes - dotfiles

My personal linux dotfiles and configs. I've modified the multicolor theme from [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats) and added a TokyoNight style and colors, among other improvements.
Bellow are a set of instructions on how to use it.

## AwesomeWM

Copy the ```awesome``` folder into ~/.config and reload AwesomeWM.
You'll need [awesome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets) for some awesome widgets to work. Just follow the link install instructions.
You will also need a patched font for the icons. I'm using CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font. If you chose a different font, remember to change config files accordingly (theme.lua, alacritty.yml, etc).

## Alacritty

Need a Nerd Font. Download the ones you like, and customize in config files. I'm using the CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font.

## Picom

I'm using picom as composer. The config file ajust vsync, opacity, shadow, etc.

## Bash

Install [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), and choose the theme you like.

## Neovim

Need [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed to run the PlugInstall command in nvim. Use ```:checkhealth``` to install missing stuff.

## Rofi themes

Get the simple-tokyonight theme from [https://github.com/lr-tech/rofi-themes-collection](https://github.com/lr-tech/rofi-themes-collection). I've modified it to be a bit wider and centered.
