# Felipe Gomes - dotfiles
My personal linux dotfiles and configs. Bellow are a set of instructions on how to use it.

## AwesomeWM
Need [awesome-wm-widgets](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets) for some awesome widgets to work. Just follow the link install instructions.
You will also need a patched font for the icons. I'm using Hack Nerd Font and a customized version of the multicolor theme.

## Alacritty
Need a Nerd Font. Download the ones you like, and customize in config files. I'm using the Hack Nerd Font.

## Bash
Install [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash), so you can use the [agnoster](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/wiki/Themes#agnoster) theme.

## Neovim
Need [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed to run the PlugInstall command in nvim.
